    <h1>Steffers</h1>
    <p>Do not go gentle into that good night,
      Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
      Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
      
     <p>Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
      Because their words had forked no lightning they
      Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>
      
      <p>Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
      Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
      Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
      
      <p>Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
      And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
      Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>
      
      <p>Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
      Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
      Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
      
      <p>And you, my father, there on the sad height,
      Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
      Do not go gentle into that good night.
      Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
